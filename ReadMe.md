# grpc-example

This is an example of how to use gRPC with CMake.

The principal usage is in src/proto/CMakeList.txt.

This repo bootstraps vcpkg to provide gRPC if the option `-DBOOTSTRAP_VCPKG=ON`
is passed to CMake during configuration. A local installation could be used via
its associated toolchain file, or gRPC/protobuf could be provided via any other
toolchain or `find_package()` discovery mechanism.
